# bugg-handover

This repository contains a document detailing the design and assembly instructions for the hardware of a Bugg recording device (including both the electronics and mechanical enclosure components). 

The firmware running on the device (and associated documentation) can be found in [``bugg-cm4-firmware``](https://github.com/bugg-resources/bugg-cm4-firmware).

Within the [main handover document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bugg-resources/bugg-handover/master/bugg-handover.pdf?token=GHSAT0AAAAAABSRG7B7T6BEZWMJQBPE7FNYYSNI6KQ) there is a design overview, full manufacture and assembly instructions, and a list of errata that are due to be changed in the next revision.

The repositories referenced in the document which host the electrical and mechanical CAD source files are:
* [``sp-hardware-main``](https://github.com/bugg-resources/sp-hardware-main): main module PCB eCAD files
* [``sp-hardware-led``](https://github.com/bugg-resources/sp-hardware-led): led module PCB eCAD files
